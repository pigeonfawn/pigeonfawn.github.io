1. Would you rather have grapefruit sized dick or a watermelon shaped boobs? 
Both of these are answered as we exist. 

2. What movie have you re-watched the most number of times? 
That's definitely Pokemon 2000. Probably tied with the Digimon movie actually. With X MEN first class following shortly after. 

3. What is the longest amount of time you have gone without doing laundry?
I go for as long as I'm still in the clear with clean underwear, so probably a month or a month and a half, even though everything gets really gross after that point. Laziness prevails over the motivation to do laundry and then fold laundry and then bring it upstairs and then put it away. Not my forte. 

4. What’s the worst thing about your gender?
As a whole everything. But specifically periods. And the era of insecutiry that women bring to each other. 

5. What’s the first thing you think about in the morning? 
Probably peeing honestly. Like, depending on dreams it may be what I dreamt about and how I have to tell whoever was in the dream, but mostly I never do because unless it's Brennan and was like, a sex dream, then it's not normally interesting enough to share right away. 

6. What website do you visit the most? 
-Tumblr 
-Neopets
-Facebook
