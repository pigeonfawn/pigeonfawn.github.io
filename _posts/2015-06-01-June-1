1. Do you sleep with your closet doors open or closed?
If I'm in my own house I sleep with them open, if I'm in someone else's house then I prefer them to be closed. Especially if I'm sleeping in my own room. If I'm in a room with someone it doesn't bother me though. 

2. Do you take the shampoos and conditioner bottles from hotel?
Uhhhh not really no??? I took the white tea moisturizer a few times before though. 

3. Do you sleep with your sheets tucked in or out?
TUCKED IN OH MY GOD there is nothing worse than having the sheets untucked and ruining your bed in the morning. 

4. Have you ever stolen a street sign before?
I stole a washroom tag sign once while in Edmonton, but never a whole street sign.

5. Do you like to use post-it notes?
I guess??? I mostly just use them for disposable drawings, you know?
